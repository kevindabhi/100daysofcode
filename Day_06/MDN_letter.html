<h1>RE: Eileen Dover university application</h1>

<p>Dear Eileen,</p>

<p>Thank you for recent application to join us at the Univesity of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your <acronym title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD </acronym> next year. I will answer your questions one by one in the following sections.</p>


<p><h2>Starting Dates</h2></p>

<p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester, the start dates for each ones are as follows: </p>


<ul>
<li> <time>First semester : 9 September 2016</time></li>   
<li> <time>Second semester : 15 January 2017</time></li>   
<li> <time>Third emeseter : 2 May 2017</time></li>   
 
</ul>
<p>Please let us know if ithis is ok, and if so which date you would prefer.</p>
 
<p>You can find more information about <a href="https://www.example.com"> important university dates</a> on our website.</p>


<p><h2>Subjects of study</h2></p>
<p>
At the awesome science faculty we have a pretty open-minded research facilty -- as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the real
of science and technology. you seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and 
just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted
we were most inrigued by are as follows, in order of priority.</p>

<ol>
<li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>o into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratorl (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>13</sub>)
    <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayer at temperature exceeding 30 <span>&#8451;</span> (86<span>&deg; </span>F), when the audience size exponentially
increases (effect 3 x 10<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;>&nbsp;3x10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
<li><acronym title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</acronym> and <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
</ol>
<p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including 
how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resourece, and anything else you'd think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>


<h2>Exotic dance moves.</h2>
Yes, you're right. As part of my post-doctoral work. I did study exotic tribal dances.
To answer your question my favourite dances are follows, with definition:<br>
<dl>
<dt>Polynesian Chicken Dance.</dt>

<dd>  A littkle known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300 <acronym title="Before Christ">BC</acronym>, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens to 
        encourage their livestock or be "fruitful"</dd>
    <dt>  Icelandci browmian shuffle</dt>
       <dd> Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to pracetice this dance. Which involved hudding close together
        in a circle oon the floor and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say 
        that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>

    <dt>Arctic robot dance.</dt>
<dd> An interesting example of historic misinformation, English exploreres in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new danc style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practised
 by inhavitantas of Northern Alaska and canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this beceuase thy were really cold.</dd>
</dl>
